Simulation of Mathematical Modelling on Oxidation Reaction using Reverse Flow Reactor
GUI Matlab

This GUI is simulated a mathematical model of oxidation reaction using reverse flow reactor. The mathematical model approached by finite different method. This model is studied the dynamic behavior of temperature and concentration in the reactor. In this GUI, the feed gas function discribed by 3 form : Periodic, Constants, and Like square Wave function.
